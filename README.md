# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a Java-based desktop application that visualizes different sorting algorithms in real-time. The application is built using JavaFX for the graphical interface and supports various sorting techniques to help users understand how each algorithm works step by step.

## Features
- Visualize popular sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Radix Sort
- Real-time sorting visualization with animation.
- User-friendly graphical interface.
- Choose array size and sorting algorithm from the UI.
- Display of unsorted and sorted arrays along with time taken.
- Generate a random array of integers for each run.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- JavaFX SDK 24
